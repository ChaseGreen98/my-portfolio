        <p>Hi! My name is Chase, and I grew up in Water Valley, Mississippi. I'm currently attending Base Camp, a prestigious coding academy to further pursue the passion for tech that's been a driving force in my life. Gaining knowledge of various coding languages and frameworks such as Python, HTML & CSS, Java, Godot, and others has only reinforced my love for all things tech. I have a passion for both software and hardware; my journey started by self teaching myself how to fix gaming consoles, even briefly freelancing as an IT tech for hardware troubleshooting. I'm looking to break into the tech industry; I have a particular interest in AI development, game development, as well as server/cloud architecture. Whether it's building computers part by part or making the software that runs them, I'm the guy ready and excited to get on it.</p>
